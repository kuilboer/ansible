# ansible

This repository is intended to capture changes to my workstation configuration.

I got the initial idea from a two part blog on opensource.com which you can find [here](https://opensource.com/article/18/3/manage-workstation-ansible) and [here](https://opensource.com/article/18/3/manage-your-workstation-configuration-ansible-part-2)

## commands
### git commands

    git add <list of updated files>
    git commit -m "<change description>"
    git push origin master

### ansible

    sudo ansible-pull -U https://github.com/kuilboer/ansible.git/
